# Classes
The class Treningsapp.js connects to the database.
The class Bruker.js refers to the Bruker(meaning user) table in the database.

# Setup
To set up the environment, you'll need to instantiate a database named "treningsdagbok" in the case of this program. The server, along with the fully setup database has to be set up before the program is run.
It's important to put the mysql-connector-java-8.0.15.jar file into library to ensure that the program connects to the database.
